  <h1>Values: The Non-Coding Kind</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>June 19, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>We were provided with a list of values and were told to pick the ones that were relevant when we were the most happy. In total I picked eleven but when asked to rate each according to the values we try to live up to I only rated one higher than all the others, leadership. Leadership is an extremely important value in my life because it is a role that I have currently embody in a lot of my environments. I am a dance teacher, the  director of about 3 different companies, and hold a pretty high role in the hip hop dance community. I have also somewhat become a leader in my current workplace and in my relationships. And I guess most importantly, I indentify myself as a leader. I have prided myself on my leadership abilities and therefore coined myself as so.
    </p>
    <p>Although I have been in a leadership role for quite some time, I have had some pretty deep inner struggles with confidence. I have gotten into funks where I have really questioned whether I was entitled to the high roles I was given and questioned whether I was even capable of living up to the expectations associated with these roles. I remember reaching out to a friend, telling her my doubts about myself and how it really related to the pressures around my role. She told me to not question why I was given what I given or why I earned what I earned, but rather, to focus on where I can take it and what I can do with it. This advice has really helped me as a leader and person in general.
    </p>
    <p>I also see this advice really helping me at DBC. There have been numerous times during Phase 0 where my confidence has gotten the best of me. I have questioned whether I am capable of being a programmer and whether I am capable of even getting through Phase 0. But my friends advice has really pushed me to realize that I am here for a reason. I got here for a reason. And even if I may not currently be the best in our cohort doesn't mean I can't try to become one. Being able to recognize my worth and potential is something I have struggled with, but am slowly beginning to get the hang of. I know I will experience some of these moments of self doubt during DBC but as long as I keep in mind that I can do anything I set my mind to, I am sure I will get through it.
