  <h1>Ruby vs. JS</h1>
  <h2>Taking a closer look at the differences/similarities between Ruby & Javascript.</h2>

    <p>This weeks shift to Javascript has been particularly difficult for me as I was just beginning to get more comfortable Ruby! Even now there are still some concepts I am shakey with. So, what better way to fine tune my understanding than to analyze the similarities/differences between the two! Although there are many, this blog will particularly focus on comparing Ruby Hashes to Javascript Objects.
    </p>
    <p>Javascript objects are simply data structures that have properties. There are numerous ways to write objects (which confused me for awhile). There is literal notation and constructor functions. Below are various ways to write an object with properties in literal notation. We define a variable called "obj" and assign it the "name" property with a value of "Adam".<br><br>

      Because everything in JS is an object, you can also assign a function as a property to the object in order to assign it some type of method. The image below illustrates assigning the "sayHi" function to the "obj" object. Therefore, when the "sayHi" function is called on "obj", it will return the string "hi" to the console. Note, that you must put the parenthesis, (), after a function or it will treat it as a property!<br>

        JS objects are very similar to Ruby hashes. Not only do they look similar but they accomplish the same things.With hashes, you take a key, equate it to a value and assign it to an object. The image below shows how this would be done. <br><br>
