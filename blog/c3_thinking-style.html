    <p>When I took the personal thinking style quiz I got "random abstract".

        When I started Phase 0 this actually scared me. Knowing that I was going into a remote intensive program and being told I excell in people-oriented environments didn't really line up. Luckily, the pairing has made Phase 0 still very people-oriented. And I have definitely found this to be true. I think I have gained the most insight from the pairing sessions and videos. There is something about having things explained to me in a deconstructed manner that really seems to make sense.

        I definitely need to get used to a more structured way of learning and not let it discourage me. Stick to time blocking and take my time trying to unpack some of the intimidating articles provided.
