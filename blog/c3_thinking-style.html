    <p>When I took the personal thinking style quiz I got "random abstract".

        When I started Phase 0 this actually scared me. Knowing that I was going into a remote intensive program and being told I excell in people-oriented environments didn't really line up. Luckily, the pairing has made Phase 0 still very people-oriented. And I have definitely found this to be true. I think I have gained the most insight from the pairing sessions and videos. There is something about having things explained to me in a deconstructed manner that really seems to make sense.

        Because of this though it has been a little difficult to understand and keep up with some of the dense material. I definitely need to get used to a more structured way of learning and not let it discourage me. Stick to time blocking and take my time trying to unpack some of the intimidating articles provided.

      Revisiting of idea of growth vs. fixed has definitely been a motivator to not get discouraged by my failures. I definitely need to remember that the things I struggled with are also things I have overcome. I definitely need to set small goals for myself throughout the week, in terms of the curriculum and in terms of personal growth. Although I am struggling, achieving these small goals will help become a more well rounded programmer and person.
