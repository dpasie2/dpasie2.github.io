  <h2>When to use what?</h2>

    <p>After this weeks exercise I realized I had many questions. One of which being the difference between arrays and hashes. I found myself not really knowing when to use what.
    </p>
    <p>
    After reading a couple stackoverflow answers I think I found some pretty understandable answers.

    Arrays are lists or ordered slots. We use them when we need to store a number of words, integers, arrays, etcetera in one place so they do not get mixed with other variables. Below is an example of an array:


    </p>

    In Chris Pine's book, he really described hashes well. Unlike arrays, they are lists or slots, but they are unordered. Therefore, they are not numbered like arrays are. They are assigned a key value, one that you set. Below is an example of a hash:
    </p>
  my_info = { :first_name =>"Davina",
  :last_name => "Pasiewicz",
  :hometown => "Chicago",
  :age => 23}
