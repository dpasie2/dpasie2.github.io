  <h2>Object Oriented Programming: Classes vs. Modules</h2>
  <h4>June 8th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>For this blog, I will look further into the difference between classes and modules. Modules can be thinked of as ways to store functions and access them from anywhere in the program. One post on stackoverflow referred to modules as a "library". Similar to modules, classes also store functions. The good thing about classes, and probably why they are used more often, is that they can be used to create numerous instances of the stored information without interferring with one another. Modules will remain constant throughout the entire program. Both seem to come in handy but staying in line with the best practices we have read about this week, I would imagine that classes allow for more changable code. I found some more differences but I am not sure we have worked with them enough for me to fully understand them so I will hold off on including them in my blog for now.
