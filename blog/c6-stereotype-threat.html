    <p>"Stereotype threat", a theory developed by Claude Steele, researches minority under-achievement and how preconceived notions of person can hinder their abilities. After watching his lectures and reading some articles, I believe I have a pretty firm understanding of what it is and how I relate to it. According to reducingstereotypethreat.org, a stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group (Steele & Aronson, 1995).

    <p>For this assignment, Dev has asked us to ananlyze and learn about the possibility of stereotype threats during our experience at DBC. Personally, although it did not initially pop in my head, I think I have become subject to a stereotype threat but probably through my own doing. I have been really focused on the fact that I am a beginner during my time with DBC. To the point where I sometimes feel discouraged or initimidated from completing certain tasks or as if I will eventually be kicked out. I think overall my biggest fear is that I am too inexperienced to succeed. When Steele talked about how the contingencies that affect our abilities most are the ones that are threatening, it completely clicked that this stereotype threat of "beginner" has really affected me. He spoke about it in the context of sex and race, and I began to question if my unready mindset had anything to do with the fact that I was a female minority, but I was not convinced enough in my thoughts to conclude so. Although, it was a very interesting notion I would like to think more about. Looking at this theory has really made me realize that your perception of yourself can really alter your performance. This is not so complex of a thought when you actually give it some time, but it is definitely see something I can see myself getting wrapped up in during my DBC experience. At least now that I am more concious of it I can try to take more steps to steer away from what I am seeing as such a strong possibility, rather than attributing it to an unchangable characteristic of myself. Success does not and will not depend on this.
