  <h1>Margin? Border? Padding? Heh?!</h1>
  <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
  <h4>May 10, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Throughout the HTML/CSS week at Dev Bootcamp, I must say that understanding margins, borders, and padding was one of my biggest struggles. All the explanations and diagrams made sense, but when actually defining and playing with them on my own site, I found it very easy to get confused and which was which. This blog will explore and hopefully enlighten you and myself on the differences between each!

        This was the diagram that we were provided. A little much at first glance huh? Yea, I thought so too.

        To explain a little better, your webpage will consist of many elements, the diagram above analyzes a single element on a page.The margin is the space added to the <span><b>outside</b></span> of the element and will determine how far it is from the other elements on the page. The border is what <span><b>outlines</b></span> your element. It can adjust the thickness, color, etc. or your border. Finally, the padding is the space <span><b>inside</b></span> your border. The padding determines how far the border is from your content (text, for example.)

        Hopefully, that diagram makes a little more sense to you now. It sure does to me! Cheers!
