  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <h2>How To Ask Good Questions!</h2>
  <h4>June 28, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>The questions that come to mind are definitely ones where I hit a bug in my code and had to reach out to another cohort mate for help. In some cases, my mate seemed to understand fairly well what I was asking, while in a few others, lots of additional explaining was necessary to get us on the same page. When looking back at the situation and researching good question asking practices I realize that there were definitely a lot of things I could have done better. Although I don't prefer the language "good" and "bad" questions, I am pretty confident that mine were closer to what is called good. I explained the problem in depth and provided them with the tools necessary to analyze my code and the specific part I thought was problematic.

      After researching, I did realize that there were a lot of things I could have done better. One suggestion was to track your research. I realized that a lot of the time the person I was consulting for help had not realized all of the solutions I had attempted. So them suggesting something and taking the time to explain it to only be faced with me turning it down and telling them I tried it already was probably a little discrediting. I definitely could have laid out what I had done beforehand. In general I think tracking research would also help refine the process as well. I probably would have taken much better researching routes if I kept better track of what I had done. This way I could avoid searching the same related things over and over again once I realized those general topics were dead ends.

    <p>Overall, many of the resources provided seem to pertain to actually posting questions online. Which probably points out a big problem for me in itself. I have been pretty hesitant from posting on our google+ page or any online forum in fear of asking a "bad" question or seeming amateur. But this is doing nothing but restaining my potential. I've realized through out phase 0 that my biggest struggle has been mental. Insecurities have definitely gotten the best of my learning capabilities. But DBC has done a great job at trying to stray me away from these thoughts. Even in this exercise, it was stated how DBC loves when students ask questions and how pertinent they are. I need to keep this in mind and realize that asking questions, whether "good" or "bad", is still good.
