  <h1>Needback</h1>
  <h2>My thoughts on pairing session feedback.</h2>
  <h4>May 30, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>I am now in week 5 of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp and received quite a bit of feedback on the pairing sessions I have shared thus far. I know some people have not been thrilled about having to pair but personally, I definitely see the necessity and benefits of pairing.
    </p>
    <p>Now I am sure it relates to my thinking/learning style, but working through a problem with someone else has almost always been more productive than trying to trudge through a challenge on my own. Often times, my pair has either cleared up my confusions or offset my discouragement for having those confusions in the first place. I found myself really easily getting lost in my thoughts and insecurities when tackling these challenges. Pairing and feedback on almost every occasion has either pulled me away from these thoughts or simply rerouted my attention to things I can improve on, both of which have been crucial to my improvement.
    </p>
    <p>I have had an irrational fear of "driving" during pairing sessions due to my lack of technical knowledge and experience. Also, because during my first few sessions my pairs were what I will call very "aggressive" drivers. Their behavior became ingrained in my head as what is expected of a driver. After receiving feedback from pairs suggesting I drive next time I decided to just do it. Punch fear in the face right? Luckily, my first driving experience was just what I needed and really debunked all the irrational fears I had of driving. My pair was a great navigator and didn't let my technical brain farts hold back our progress or overwhelm me with embarrasment. Since then all of my pairing session have not been such a daunting task. They have actually been something I look forward to as they have often gotten me out of jams or cleared up some small syntax questions I have had. It's amazing what two heads can do compared to one.
    </p>
    <p>Receiving constructive feedback has been useful but writing it has been useful as well. Defining my own expectations of my pair has really helped me analyze more closely what I should be doing as well. It has been a little difficult addressing people's weak points but I can't imagine that ever being easy per say. Overall, pairing has been very useful and I am looking forward to doing it more in Dev Bootcamp as well as my work environment.
