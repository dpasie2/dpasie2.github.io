    <p>A couple weeks ago I visited San Francisco for the 4th time within the last 3 years. Although the beauty and unbeatable weather has remained unchanged, one thing that I have seen progressively worsen over the years is the social and cultural hatred towards the tech industry. As I walked around the mission, I noticed numerous murals declaring techies and tech companies as the reason for SF's diminishing culture and diversity.
    </p>
    <p>During my stay in SF, I crashed with some friends of mine who are actually programmers. I asked for their side of the story.They explained to me how there is a real estate shortage in this tiny 7x7 mile city. As tech businesses and start ups are booming, more and more people are moving into the city. With short supply and high demand, San Francisco has become the most expensive city to live in the nation. To give you an idea, one-bedroom apartments typically rent for $3,000 per month while the median price for a home is $1,000,000. Of course, these sky high and growing prices are becoming hard to manage for low to medium-income residents who have lived in SF for decades. Many people who have taken pride in their hometown have been forced to leave. So, the question I want to focus on is: who is to blame?
    </p>
    <p>According to the murals and angry uber drivers I spoke to, the tech industry and "young computer kids" are completely to blame. Google has a shuttle bus that transports its employees living in SF and Oakland to their corporate campus in Silicon Valley. Although ecofriendly and convenienent, these busses have been seen as a symbol of gentrification and displacement to city-dwellers. On many occasions, these busses have been paint bombed, halted by protesters, and even damaged/vandalized.
    </p>
    <p>After reading more on this brewing war I have come to a few determinations. There is undoubtadly a crisis and it is undoubtadly unforunate that some of the city's most diverse and long term residents are being affected. But I also think are other factors that need to be taken into consideration when trying to determine who exactly is to blame. After some research I learned a a ton but am only going to mention a few interesting facts that I think are crucial to consider. First, the city government has not worked in cohesion with these companies to make situations better. For example, many protestors have said that Google should build housing on the Silicon Valley campus itself and therefore keep the employees from residing in SF or Oakland. Valid point? But the Mountain View City Council has actually forbidden it, as it would threaten the city's owl population. Next, I want to take a look at San Francisco's below-market-rate, or BMR, program. Many cities have a BMR program that is incentivized and required in new developments. BMR has become almost the only option for most low to moderate-income residents. But the odds of getting a BMR unit are 1 in 10. There simply aren't enough of them. So the city set a the BMR unit requirement to 60% in 2009 but after hesitation from development it has been lowered to 15%. Also, the city's average height restriction for new development is 4-stories.
    </p>
    <p>In conclusion, I want to point out that there are multiple factors that have contributed to the crisis. That placing all of the blame on the inevidable advancement of technology is not necessarily fair. The city and restrictions on development have surely contributed to the issues. Overall, there are some steps on both ends that can be done. The city can lift restrictions on development and present more incentives to build more affordable housing. Tech industries can invest in public tokens of commitment to the city and reserving its diversity. The possibilities towards progress are endless.<br>
