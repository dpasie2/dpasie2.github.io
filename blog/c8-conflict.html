    <p>At my current job, the rules that my boss expects of us are not always explicitly stated. A lot of the time, we will get in trouble for things we didn't know were problematic or upsetting to him. Although I know not to take these situations personal, it took me a long time to develop this ability. Recently actually, a situation happened at my office when a few of my coworkers and I went downstairs to grab breakfast/coffee. This was our office norm, even the office manager frequently would take a quick stop to downstairs for breakfast. When we had gone down one of our orders had gotten messed and we therefore were downstairs a few more minutes than we normally would be. When we got back to the office, my boss exploded. One by one he went up to my coworkers threatening to fire them and telling them that it was completely unexceptable that we went downstairs. Once he got to me, I calmly said, "Okay, I am sorry. I will clock out for my lunch and work through it now if you like?". He said "GOOD" and went on to yell at the next person. After the situation cooled down, my other coworkers came up to me and said they were very surprised by my reaction. They expected me to argue or debate with him. But at that moment, it just didn't seem necessary and I realized afterwards how much better the situation turned out because of how patiently I handled it. Although, yes, I was upset and felt it was unfair, me voicing that in that context would not have accomplished anything besides probably making him more upset. If I could go back I would not have done anything differently. It was definitely a learning experience that I took a lot from and hopefully will be able to exercise in the future when encountering these types of situations.
