        After doing the challenges and exercises, I am really beginning to understand the benefits of versional control. While doing these challenges on my own I have already stumbled across times that I wanted to back track after hitting an error. Now, imagining working on a program together, with my fellow grasshoppers in a much largers scale, makes the necessity of version control completely apparent. Having the ability to simultaneously work on a project and be able to consolidate our edits into one master version would be mandatory for efficiency. It would guarantee that one programmer wouldn't over write anothers code. It would guarantee that if we came across a bug in our program, we could revert back to an earlier checkpoint in our program from which we wanted to start anew.Overall, version control, git in our case, seem to prevent lost work or bugged code from being a legitimate problem.

        When ever you make a change to your local file on your computer, you can git track the changes. This will allow you commit the changes once ready. By keep files in "stages", it allows you to revert back to different versions of your file. Below are intructions on how to push changes.

        So, once you have made your changes using sublime, save the file.

        Create a new branch, within the directory pertaining to the changed file. "git checkout -b <NEW BRANCH NAME>"

        Check the git status.

        Add the changes you made to the stage. "git add <changed file>"

        Commit the changes you've made. "git commit -m "DESCRIBE THE CHANGES YOU MADE"

        Check the "git log" to see if the changes have been committed.

        Check the master branch. "git co master"

        Pull changes from the remote to your local copy. "git pull"

        Go back to your editing branch. "git co <EDITING BRANCH>"

        Merge the branches."git merge master"

        Then push it to Github. "git push origin <EDITING BRANCH>"

        Then you can create a pull request on your github user account and apply the changes to your live site.

        Storing code on Github is useful, especially for us Phase 0-ers, because it allows multiple to work on a file from anywhere at anytime. Because git is software that is stored locally, you would only be able to work on it with others when in the same network. One article equated git to a flashstick. Sharing information on the flashstick would obviously be very limited. This would be problematic especially when there are large teams in different places working on the same program. Which is where Github comes into play. The same article I referenced above equated Github to dropbox. A place to store code that is remote, or located on the internet, making it much more accessible.
