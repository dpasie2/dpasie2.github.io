        This video was exactly what I needed as he addressed a lot of the worries and questions that I have had. I love how he compared DBC to working in a kitchen as opposed to sitting at a table. Everyone is in the DBC journey together working to create beautiful things. Being a beginner, it was very comforting hearing this and also hearing that the environment rarely strays away from being encouraging as opposed to competitive. He spelled out my biggest fear within this process, not being experienced or qualified compared to my peers, but instantly comforted me by saying that they are not only prepared to handle that but are expecting it. It also really helped when he explained how in the grand scope of things, we are all still beginners and all can learn from this program.

        I definitely see myself doing well in this "kitchen" culture. I like working with others and I have always been told that I am good at articulating my thoughts and ignorance. I am glad that I have found a work environment where this is embraced and encouraged, definitely was something I didn't know existed before looking into programming.

         My expectations of DBC have not really changed. More, they have been comforted. One thing that I've felt is that I don't REALLY know what they define as "beginner". That DBC's version of beginner will be way more advanced than my own. But my experience in phase thus far has continuously shown my otherwise. We are all beginners and, even if some are more experienced than others, we can all serve as learning tools and motivators to each other. I am very excited to learn in this kind of environment. I am excited to just be passionate about work/homework/waking up in the morning in general, it's been a long time since that has happened. Of course I am nervous, but it's that good kind of nervous, that excited kind of nervous.
